## INTRODUCTION 

Fun Gym is a responsive, accessible, and easy-to-understand static website designed to serve gym members and potential members who are curious about the gym's procedures. It aims to connect people to the gym by providing them with the best possible experience.

A general goal is to keep our community motivated to exercise frequently in the UK. Trainers, professionals, students looking for assistance, local councils, and charities supporting the disabled and vulnerable can benefit from the website. Further, it will help families with children and companies that value their employees by showing them when and where they must join to get the most out of it.

As a final point, the developer/owner has combined design and technology to create a terrific website by applying User Experience Design (UXD). Also, a valued website inevitably comes through a user-centred design (UCD) based upon principles, standards, and professional advice provided by the South Devon University Centre College and the Code Institute.

## INTERLUDE

 - ### TOOLKITS:
While I will use HTML and CSS to implement a static front-end web application, I will also use many other tools and technologies. 
Click [stream-one](https://amir-rastkhadiv.github.io/my-brilliant-template/index.html) to make things easier.  
 Using the Code Institute module in LMS, I learned to code, gather technical information, and create a robust toolkit. To add further:[TECHNOLOGIES-USED](#TECHNOLOGIES-USED)

 -  ### WEB DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODERN ERA:
 Three parts make up the modern web. Front-end, back-end, and middleware . Each layer includes a set of technologies. Examples include: 
The structure is HTML, the facade is CSS, and the functionality is JavaScript.

Backend languages such as Python, PHP, and Ruby can access databases, web services, and other data sources. A middleware layer relays information between the front and backend. Obtaining responses and requests for HTTP, Accessed APIs,
authentication, routing, and sessions.

Let's only explore HTML and CSS here. Google Chrome also comes with a set of web development tools. I'll use this as my primary tool. I can inspect and analyze a web page (test CSS style changes and debug code).

Please read the following sections to gain further insight.

-  ### A WEBPAGE? WHAT IS A WEBSITE? HOW ABOUT A GOOD ONE? 

This project aims to answer these questions. I used the simple, noble and versatile "WH Questions" technique at all stages. What steps should I take? Which resources can I consult? There are several steps.

Here's what the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/blog/makes-good-website/) says about the above question. What do you think? 

[Share your thoughts!](https://amir-rastkhadiv.github.io/fun-gym/)  


-  ### TERMINOLOGY:
   -  #### UXD
   User experience refers to how something affects a person.
This discipline ensures that a product works is simple, intuitive, and enjoyable to use.
Embedding user experience strategies at the beginning of the development process is essential. UX is all about ensuring "yes" at all times.

   -  #### UCD
   By using user-centered design, we can achieve a positive user experience. In fact, user-centered design ensures that your product will be loved by users over and over again.

   -  #### UID
   In human-computer interaction (HCI), a user interface is the interface between humans and machines. In this way, the machine is controlled and operated from the human end, while simultaneously providing information to aid the operator's decision-making.

   - #### WHAT DOES SOFTWARE CRAFTMANSHIP ENTAIL?
   A software craftsman believes that software design is more than just hammering the keyboard until your program works as it should. A good approach is to consider the total cost of ownership of a product, e.g., the costs of developing the software and fixing all the defects and maintaining it for many years to come.

My work on the Fun Gym website has focused on generating positive user experiences by mapping, designing an incredible journey, and arranging details for creating the product, all while interacting with web applications.When you fully understand the framework's intricacies, it's enjoyable to write beautiful, well-factored code along with a deadline.

## USER EXPERIENCE (UX)

- ### GETTING STARTED

To begin, let's review the essential What, Who, Which, and Where questions. Visual learners tend to find these simple WH questions easy since you can use visual aids, like a picture or an object, as hints. Then, it is simple to move on to asking "When," "Why," and "How."

[Keep Things on Track by Asking the Right Questions](https://amir-rastkhadiv.github.io/fun-gym/)

- ### WHAT EXACTLY IS USER EXPERIENCE?

In a nutshell, a helpful, usable, and valuable product is user experience(UX). It identifies and describes a product's goals, user interface, and interaction with users to determine its success.

There are five phases in UX: strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface. These include tasks, functionality, and information. Therefore, it would be better to prioritize a specific project goal while simultaneously dealing with data.

Figure 2 illustrates precisely how the process works. 

![Figure 2: Process For UX Design(https://ozchen.com)](./assets/img/figure-2-uxd.png)

Click [here](https://ozchen.com/5-planes-content-strategy/) for more information. 


- ### WHAT IS THE UX SYSTEM IS USED FOR? 

Using the above design system helps you do two things well: Improve consistency and receive coded patterns that you can quickly implement for the following project.
A UX is composed of connected planes. Planes will exchange information, resulting in a complete product. In this process, flexibility is paramount.


![FIGURE 3: A UX is composed of connected planes.](./assets/img/fig-3-ux.png)

- ### STRATEGY OVERVIEW (DESIGN AND BUSINESS)

According to Einstein, "If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions."

Generally, problems are necessary for the accomplishment of any worthwhile task. In wise terms, preparation is a valuable tool in solving problems. 

The task is to define a project by identifying questions and analyzing each issue. All it takes is some questions, some research, and some planning.

![Figure 4: UX design scheme from scratch to finished product..](./assets/img/fig-4-uxd-s.png)

Divide the project into minor problems and concentre on each of them. Analyze your options by determining the pros and cons of each decision. What is the best time not to repeat a procedure? What is your experience? Where can you find resources in your toolkit that might help?

- ### WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR GYMS?

Segmentation analyses indicate that females are the target audience for gyms. Specifically, Zone Fitness targets women aged 25-40. In health and fitness centres, working-class women enjoy exercising while they relax.

Thus, having a hero image from the target audience would be great. 

- ### WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH?

  I am trying to achieve the following:
  - Develop a gym enthusiast's website. 
  - Compile an industrial work portfolio.
  - Produce an Academic project template. 
  - Enjoy all aspects and say yes to all challenges.  
  - Learn new skills. 
  - Manage time and deadlines effectively.
  - Comply with all high-level assessment requirements.  

- ### WHAT TIPS DO YOU HAVE FOR NAMEING A GYM PROJECT?

  Top tips for branding the gym website:

  - Short and memorable name
  - Unique and different from other local brands 
  - Consistent with the gym's underlying principles
  - Create a strong impression
  - Specific constraints on domain names
  - Clearly define the business
  - Target market
  - Thinking to all users
  - Project directory rules   
  - GitHub Repository/Pages conventions 

  Choosing a name was one of the most challenging decisions I've ever made as a designer, developer, and website owner. I did a lot of research, for example, looking for top brand names, Meta or Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Apple, Code Institue, Virgin etc. 
  
  Thankfully, there are domain generators, and it's crucial to get a term appearing on search engine results. Also, I considered several other gym competitors before I decided on the current name. Last but not least, I should think of my website users. Do they find it inspiring? And is it easy for them to pronounce? What comes to mind when they hear it? Quite an interesting question to ask developers, parents, etc. 

In conclusion, the website was named Fun Gym. 


-   ### USER STORIES

Fun Gym websites cater to a significant segment of the population. Gym users, local communities, health and fitness professionals, tech companies, universities, research institutions, and colleges, as well as potential business investors.

“When you have a clear vision of your goal, it’s easier to take the first step toward it.” [L.L. Cool J., rapper and actor](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19547200/best-fitness-quotes-of-all-time/)

Hence: 
-   #### First Time Visitor Goals: 

    - If I visit a website, I look for something nearly similar to the market or relevant to the business. Having some uniqueness, though, would be great, as well as something that motivates me to delve deeper into the website. 

    - The first impression can be a welcome message, a nice logo, an affable hero image, whatever catches my eye at first glance. It may offer a great deal/discount/features compared to its competitors.
    
    - First-time visitor, I am looking for a responsive and accesible website providing access to working hours, gym locations, and facilities clasess, by viewing an encouraging photo or content. A memorable experience could motivate me to visit the terms and conditions of membership quickly and easily. 
 
    - The purpose of a first visit to the site is to learn more about the organization and understand the site purpose.

    - For a first-time visitor, I must navigate the site efficiently to find information quickly.

    -  To determine whether a company is reputable, I always look for testimonials when I visit their website for the first time. Also, I want to find their social media links to see how well-known and trusted they are on social media. 

    - I am also looking for a FAQ page. In my opinion, it shows the business's responsibility to assist first-time visitors in learning about the company and feel confident about it. The most valuable service is to answer visitors' common questions outside of working hours. The page wins both ways.  

    - It is important to me to be enthusiastic enough to share it with my community and inform them about it or ask their opinion if they are already aware of it. It may make it easy for me and my family-friends, colleagues, teams  to switch to it and have [Fun Gym](https://amir-rastkhadiv.github.io/fun-gym/) all together. 

    - As a design team, my goal is to develop a front-end web application that reflects the principles of usability, accessibility, and responsiveness-a structured website with the main navigation menu. I am also anticipating three to more pages. As a design team first visitor, I hope the page shows photos/ logo featuring fun, hours, or gym schedule. It would be great if it sounded like a real-world project. The learner has documented a detailed rationale for the real-world application and provided an in-depth description of the project’s execution.

    - I am an investor interested in learning who owns FUN GYM.

    -  As a charity, I expect a donation box or page on the website of the gym.  

    -  I am new to the site as a student, so I am looking for a student membership page. A voluntary page would also be an option. 
    
    - I am looking for a career page as a potential employee, trainer, or professional. 

    - It's an honour to be a partner/federation. There is a need for an event page for public visitors for my organization. 

    - My job is to run a business and be a fan. Even at the beginning, you should advertise something about your business to respect your users and to ensure that they are treated appropriately if you can tell them that the site is under construction. Perhaps it will be just a simple webpage.  

-  #### Returning visitor goals: 

     - As a return visitor, I'm interested in learning about personal trainers, their expertise, and classes in general. 
     - Along with the customer service/client care team, please provide the contact information of the key staff and how to reach each department.
     - Pictures of important events would be helpful. Membership Achievements. If heroes exist, please include them. 

     - Visualizing actual events is essential. Achievement registries If heroes exist, list them. 

     - Updates to the website should be consistent with the previous page. Users will find it too frustrating if the site map is drastically changed. Like my first visit, I expect that it maintains the same valuable features. 

     - I am interested in viewing or downloading the Fun Gym white paper.

     - I want to see advice on how to complete the registration form step by step—something like completed sample forms and a list of requirements before attending in personal information for corresponding address or post box. 
 
     - As a student/parent,  I'm interested in learning about holiday packages. Or any events for half term. 

     -  Designers expect images to be of adequate resolution, so they do not appear pixelated or stretched, and external links open in a new tab when clicked.Implement a website whose purpose is

     - Further aims from the design team's point of view are that developing a website that aims for an easy-to-understand solution is evident to a new user without consulting supporting documentation.Describe the needs and expectations associated with the user stories.

      - As an investor/ocharities/organizations/ public visitors we are looking for the way to book meeting with the managers or the owner for our cooperation. 

      -  Professional visitors/investors/charities/organizations/public visitors are interested in meeting /seating with the managers or the owner for further engagements and potential cooperation. Therefore, we need access to the appropriate contact page. 

      - As an applicant, I expect to see details about the job opportunities and the efficient way to apply. 

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. A memorable experience could motivate me to visit the terms and conditions for extending membership quickly and easily or applying for further services. Thus, I expect it to maintain its value as I join and to keep it super and upper. So, I am interested in giving feedback page. 

        2. It would be great to have a page for membership cancellations or complaints.

        3. The frequent users of the fun gym are eagerly awaiting new features, content, classes, staff, challenging matches, and new branches for engaging further with a fun gym. 

        4.  The design team, web developers, colleagues seek outstanding craftsmanship in all phases of fun gym web development, namely design, development, and implementation. 

    -   #### Owner/Developer/Designer strategy plans  
        I am [Amir Rastkhadivmasouleh](https://amir-rastkhadiv.github.io/arastkhadiv-portfolio/index.html). As you may be aware, I am in charge of design. I deal with Fun Gym web development too. For this project, I am responsible for creating the Fun Gym website that addresses the above expectations and handling any problems to the best of my ability. Furthermore, as an owner, I considered all the presented purposes methodologies, and I have provided the following strategic plans offered here at the time to reflect my view.

        ![Strategy Map 1 (Figure 5)](/assets/img/strategy-1-fig-5.png)
        ![Strategy Map 2 (Figure 6)](/assets/img/strategy-2-fig-6.png)
        



    










        









- ### SCOPE OVERVIEW (FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS AND CONTENT REQUIREMENTS)
Currently, we are trying to align the goals with the strategic objectives and use WH questioning techniques to move slowly forward with the scope of work, but we will need to modify our approach. Why?  

According to [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein), "We cannot solve our problems by using the same reasoning we utilized to produce them."

That depends on requirements, features, and content. 
For instance, what qualities do we wish to include on the site? 

Here is where Agile methodology comes into play. Obtain a clear picture of what is currently available in terms of content and features. Describe what is now known as well as what is unknown. Streamlining the documentation will make a big difference. An agile approach implies committing to small, bite-sized pieces of development that will allow the team to learn as it goes.

Agile sprints are defined based on their duration. 
Often, sprints are short.  It is common for sprints to include collaboration and development for a few days. 

To avoid scope creep or to create an ineffectual product, our scope must not be too broad or excessively narrow. Focus on features agreed upon at the strategy level to meet deadlines.
