# FUN GYM - WEBSITE 

## ABSTRACT 

I am impressed with your interest in reading the [Fun Gym](https://amir-rastkhadiv.github.io/fun-gym/) website's README file. I am pleased to announce that I will present the User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project-1 for Code Institute's Leading Technologies HTML5 and CSS3 course. 

I promise to convey everything that I know. Ask me anything! I welcome ideas, suggestions, feedback, and the occasional rant.

If you need to contact me, you can visit the Fun Gym [website](https://amir-rastkhadiv.github.io/fun-gym/). Or submit an issue on this [repository](https://github.com/Amir-Rastkhadiv/fun-gym). Please do!


## INTRODUCTION 

Fun Gym is a responsive, accessible, and easy-to-understand static website designed to serve gym members and potential members who are curious about the gym's procedures. It aims to connect people to the gym by providing them with the best possible experience.

A general goal is to keep our community motivated to exercise frequently in the UK. Trainers, professionals, students looking for assistance, local councils, and charities supporting the disabled and vulnerable can benefit from the website. Further, it will help families with children and companies that value their employees by showing them when and where they must join to get the most out of it.

As a final point, the developer/owner has combined design and technology to create a terrific website by applying User Experience Design (UXD). Also, a valued website inevitably comes through a user-centred design (UCD) based upon principles, standards, and professional advice provided by the South Devon University Centre College and the Code Institute.

Enjoy it and happy, healthy and wealthy fit coding activity!

## INTERLUDE

 - ### TOOLKITS:
While I will use HTML and CSS to implement a static front-end web application, I will also use many other tools and technologies. 
Click [stream-one](https://amir-rastkhadiv.github.io/my-brilliant-template/index.html) to make things easier.  
 Using the Code Institute module in LMS, I learned to code, gather technical information, and create a robust toolkit. To add further:[TECHNOLOGIES-USED](#TECHNOLOGIES-USED)

 -  ### WEB DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODERN ERA:
 Three parts make up the modern web. Front-end, back-end, and middleware . Each layer includes a set of technologies. Examples include: 
The structure is HTML, the facade is CSS, and the functionality is JavaScript.

Backend languages such as Python, PHP, and Ruby can access databases, web services, and other data sources. A middleware layer relays information between the front and backend. Obtaining responses and requests for HTTP, Accessed APIs,
authentication, routing, and sessions.

Let's only explore HTML and CSS here. Google Chrome also comes with a set of web development tools. I'll use this as my primary tool. I can inspect and analyze a web page (test CSS style changes and debug code).

Please read the following sections to gain further insight.

-  ### A WEBPAGE? WHAT IS A WEBSITE? HOW ABOUT A GOOD ONE? 

This project aims to answer these questions. I used the simple, noble and versatile "WH Questions" technique at all stages. What steps should I take? Which resources can I consult? There are several steps.

Here's what the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/blog/makes-good-website/) says about the above question. What do you think?

-  ### TERMINOLOGY:
   -  #### UXD
   User experience refers to how something affects a person.
This discipline ensures that a product works is simple, intuitive, and enjoyable to use.
Embedding user experience strategies at the beginning of the development process is essential. UX is all about ensuring "yes" at all times.

   -  #### UCD
   By using user-centered design, we can achieve a positive user experience. In fact, user-centered design ensures that your product will be loved by users over and over again.

   -  #### UID
   In human-computer interaction (HCI), a user interface is the interface between humans and machines. In this way, the machine is controlled and operated from the human end, while simultaneously providing information to aid the operator's decision-making.

   - #### What does Software Craftsmanship entail?
   A software craftsman believes that software design is more than just hammering the keyboard until your program works as it should. A good approach is to consider the total cost of ownership of a product, e.g., the costs of developing the software and fixing all the defects and maintaining it for many years to come.

My work on the Fun Gym website has focused on generating positive user experiences by mapping, designing an incredible journey, and arranging details for creating the product, all while interacting with web applications.When you fully understand the framework's intricacies, it's enjoyable to write beautiful, well-factored code along with a deadline.

## USER EXPERIENCE (UX)

- ### GETTING STARTED

To begin, let's review the essential What, Who, Which, and Where questions. Visual learners tend to find these simple WH questions easy since you can use visual aids, like a picture or an object, as hints. Then, it is simple to move on to asking "When," "Why," and "How."

-  ### WHAT EXACTLY IS USER EXPERIENCE?
In a nutshell, a helpful, usable, and valuable product is user experience(UX). It identifies and describes a product's goals, user interface, and interaction with users to determine its success.
-  ### WHAT IS THE  UX SYSTEM IS USED FOR? 
Using the above design system helps you do two things well:
Improve consistency, and you receive coded patterns that you can quickly implement for the following project.

- ### WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR GYMS?
Segmentation analyses indicate that females are the target audience for gyms. Specifically, Zone Fitness targets women aged 25-40. In health and fitness centres, working-class women enjoy exercising while they relax.

Thus, having a hero image from the target audience would be great.

5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
