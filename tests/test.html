            Professor Mark Williams, former director of the Oxford Sport Centre, says that fitness
            means knowing directly what is going on inside and outside ourselves, moment by moment.
  
            "It's easy to stop noticing the world around us. It's also easy to lose touch with the way our
            bodies are feeling and to end up living 'in our heads' caught up in our thoughts without
            stopping to notice how those thoughts are driving our emotions and behaviour," he says.

          <p> As well as practising excersise in daily life, it can be helpful to set aside time for a more
            formal work out.
  
            Fun Gym meditation involves sitting silently and paying attention to thoughts, sounds, the
            sensations of breathing or parts of the body, bringing your attention back whenever the mind
            starts to wander.
  
            Yoga and tai-chi can also help with developing awareness of your breathing.
          </p>
          <p> If possible, take time each time to come  with your family; for example, try arranging a fixed time to fit
            together, or you could simply arrange a day out with our wonderful trainers. 
            Try switching off the TV to come  here or play a game with your children, friends or colleague.
            Volunteering at a fun gym, or our local community group would be a lovely idea. Find out how to
            volunteer on the Fun Gym website. 
            Make the most of fun gym technology to stay in touch with friends and family. Video-chat apps like Skype and
            FaceTime is helpful, especially if you wish to share your live excercise with the free wifi in Fun Gym.

          Most people feel stressed sometimes and some people find stress helpful or even motivating. But if stress is
          affecting your life, there are things you can try that may help.Stress is the body‚Äôs physical response to a
          real or perceived threat, demand, or danger.

          When you feel threatened, your body releases stress hormones which prepare the body to respond. This is called
          the ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù response.

          Sometimes a pressurised situation triggers a stress response. The situation may not actually put you in
          danger. But your body may react as if it does.

          A stress response can be helpful in some situations. It can increase your performance. But sometimes it can be
          detrimental to your mental health.

          Recognising the different types of stress ‚Äî and how your body responds to them ‚Äî can help you get help with
          stress when you need it.

          There are three main types of stress. These are acute, episodic acute, and chronic stress. We explore each
          type of stress below:
        <ol>
          <li>

            Stress can cause many different symptoms. It might affect how you feel physically, mentally and also how
            you
            behave.
            It's not always easy to recognise when stress is the reason you're feeling or acting differently.

              In 2019, 'burnout' was recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as an 'occupational phenomenon'.
              As lockdowns have drastically affected our work-life balance and working environments, experts have
              conducted
              regular research to ascertain the public's perceptions of burnout and the contributing factors,
              considering the pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Burnout is a state of physical and emotional exhaustion. It can occur when you experience long-term stress
              in your job, or when you have worked in a physically or emotionally draining role for a long time.

            <hr>
            <p>
              Previously, Herbert Freudenberger, an American psychologist, described the progression of burnout in 12
              stages. This was later simplified into a 5-stage version that is described below.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Honeymoon phase
                <p>
                  At this stage, there are absolutely no signs of burnout, instead, you are full of enthusiasm,
                  commitment, and joy from your work. You are very productive and take on every possible task and
                  opportunity to perform your best. You feel creative, optimistic and full of energy, and to prove your
                  skills, you may take more onto your shoulders than you should. It is particularly relevant to new job
                  roles or undertaking new work tasks and initiatives.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span> Cardio </span>
                <p>
                  You progress to the next stage when you gradually start noticing that some days are more stressful
                  than others. You lack time for personal needs, and you start seeing your family and friends less. Your
                  job might become the most important thing in your life. Some early signs of stress may start
                  bothering you, manifesting as an inability to focus, headaches, anxiety, change in appetite, and even
                  high blood pressure, to name few.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>High Intensity </span>
                <p>
                  Frequent experience of high-stress levels brings you into the stage of chronic stress. As a result,
                  your
                  problem-solving skills and performance decrease further, and at this point, you start feeling you are
                  out
                  of control and powerless. Your efforts do not seem to yield the same productive results as before. To
                  avoid facing the pressure of your tasks, you may procrastinate. You might not be praised or
                  acknowledged
                  for your achievements which can build up a sense of incompetence and failure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chronic stress takes a toll on your mental and physical health and further intensifies the symptoms
                  described in stage 2. You now may find yourself getting ill more frequently. Additionally, you may not
                  seem to regulate your emotions that well anymore. Even small things may make you aggressive,
                  resentful, or sad. You may deny the problems and distance yourself from colleagues and social life.
                  In extreme cases to escape the negative emotions, some people may even start to self-medicate
                  with alcohol or drugs.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <span>Family session </span>
                <p>
                  This stage is burnout itself. Not addressing the previous stages/ symptoms promptly can result in
                  critical exhaustion levels that will make it hard to cope with work demands. The continuous sense of
                  failure and powerlessness eventually leads to the feeling of despair and disillusionment. You don‚Äôt
                  see ‚Äòa way out‚Äô of the circumstances and become indifferent towards your work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Physical symptoms may add on and further intensify. Apart from being constantly fatigued, having
                  ongoing digestive problems, chronic headaches, you may also experience behavioural changes. The
                  developed sense of self-doubt and pessimistic outlook on your job and life can be pronounced at this
                  stage.

                  your life (3). Attempts to bring yourself back to normal is more challenging than it has ever been.
