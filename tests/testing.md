<h1 align="center">FUN GYM - TESTING  </h1>

## INTRODUCTION 

Here is the test document for [Fun Gym](https://amir-rastkhadiv.github.io/fun-gym/).

The majority of testing occurred during the development of the site. There was a great deal of trial and error during this development phase. Several significant challenges were encountered, with some taking multiple days to resolve (or finding an alternative workaround).  

The developer assessed functionality, usability, and responsiveness manually and automatically. You can find the contents of this document in its table of contents.
