<h1 align="center">FUN GYM - TESTING  </h1>

## INTRODUCTION 

Here is the test document for [Fun Gym](https://amir-rastkhadiv.github.io/fun-gym/).

The majority of testing occurred during the development of the site. There was a great deal of trial and error during this development phase. Several significant challenges were encountered, with some taking multiple days to resolve (or finding an alternative workaround).  

The developer assessed functionality, usability, and responsiveness manually and automatically. You can find the contents of this document in its table of contents.

## TESTING USER STORIES

- ## First Time Visitor Goals: 

1. If I visit a website, I look for something nearly similar to the market or relevant to the business. Having some uniqueness, though, would be great, as well as something that motivates me to delve deeper into the website. 

2. The first impression can be a welcome message, a nice logo, an affable hero image, whatever catches my eye at first glance. It may offer a great deal/discount/features compared to its competitors.

3.  First-time visitor, I am looking for a responsive and accesible website providing access to working hours, gym locations, and facilities clasess, by viewing an encouraging photo or content. A memorable experience could motivate me to visit the terms and conditions of membership quickly and easily. 

4. The purpose of a first visit to the site is to learn more about the organization and understand the site purpose.

5. For a first-time visitor, I must navigate the site efficiently to find information quickly.

6. To determine whether a company is reputable, I always look for testimonials when I visit their website for the first time. Also, I want to find their social media links to see how well-known and trusted they are on social media. 

7. I am also looking for a FAQ page. In my opinion, it shows the business's responsibility to assist first-time visitors in learning about the company and feel confident about it. The most valuable service is to answer visitors' common questions outside of working hours. The page wins both ways.  

8. It is important to me to be enthusiastic enough to share it with my community and inform them about it or ask their opinion if they are already aware of it. It may make it easy for me and my family-friends, colleagues, teams  to switch to it and have [Fun Gym](https://amir-rastkhadiv.github.io/fun-gym/) all together.

It may make it easy for me and my family-friends, colleagues, teams  to switch to it and have [Fun Gym](https://amir-rastkhadiv.github.io/fun-gym/) all together. 

10. As a design team, my goal is to develop a front-end web application that reflects the principles of usability, accessibility, and responsiveness-a structured website with the main navigation menu. I am also anticipating three to more pages. As a design team first visitor, I hope the page shows photos/ logo featuring fun, hours, or gym schedule. It would be great if it sounded like a real-world project. The learner has documented a detailed rationale for the real-world application and provided an in-depth description of the project’s execution.

11. I am an investor interested in learning who owns FUN GYM.

12. As a charity, I expect a donation box or page on the website of the gym. 

13. I am new to the site as a student, so I am looking for a student membership page. A voluntary page would also be an option. 
    
14. I am looking for a career page as a potential employee, trainer, or professional. 

15. It's an honour to be a partner/federation. There is a need for an event page for public visitors for my organization. 

16.  My job is to run a business and be a fan. Even at the beginning, you should advertise something about your business to respect your users and to ensure that they are treated appropriately if you can tell them that the site is under construction. Perhaps it will be just a simple webpage.  

- ## Returning visitor goals: 

17. As a return visitor, I'm interested in learning about personal trainers, their expertise, and classes in general. 

18. Along with the customer service/client care team, please provide the contact information of the key staff and how to reach each department.

19.  Pictures of important events would be helpful. Membership Achievements. If heroes exist, please include them.
   
20.  Visualizing actual events is essential. Achievement registries If heroes exist, list them. 
   
21. Updates to the website should be consistent with the previous page. Users will find it too frustrating if the site map is drastically changed. Like my first visit, I expect that it maintains the same valuable features. 
   
22. I am interested in viewing or downloading the Fun Gym white paper.
   
23. I want to see advice on how to complete the registration form step by step—something like completed sample forms and a list of requirements before attending in personal information for corresponding address or post box. 

 24. I want to see advice on how to complete the registration form step by step—something like completed sample forms and a list of requirements before attending in personal information for corresponding address or post box. 

25. As a student/parent,  I'm interested in learning about holiday packages. Or any events for half term. 

26. Designers expect images to be of adequate resolution, so they do not appear pixelated or stretched, and external links open in a new tab when clicked.Implement a website whose purpose is

27. Further aims from the design team's point of view are that developing a website that aims for an easy-to-understand solution is evident to a new user without consulting supporting documentation.Describe the needs and expectations associated with the user stories.

28.  As an investor/ocharities/organizations/ public visitors we are looking for the way to book meeting with the managers or the owner for our cooperation. 

29.  Professional visitors/investors/charities/organizations/public visitors are interested in meeting /seating with the managers or the owner for further engagements and potential cooperation. Therefore, we need access to the appropriate contact page. 

30.  As an applicant, I expect to see details about the job opportunities and the efficient way to apply. 

- ## Frequent User Goals

31. A memorable experience could motivate me to visit the terms and conditions for extending membership quickly and easily or applying for further services. Thus, I expect it to maintain its value as I join and to keep it super and upper. So, I am interested in giving feedback page. 

32. It would be great to have a page for membership cancellations or complaints.
   
33. The frequent users of the fun gym are eagerly awaiting new features, content, classes, staff, challenging matches, and new branches for engaging further with a fun gym. 
   
34. The design team, web developers, colleagues seek outstanding craftsmanship in all phases of fun gym web development, namely design, development, and implementation.
